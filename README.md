# Hackathon Challenge: Do masks help against COVID-19?
This is a group project for UC,Davis MSBA Hackathon Challenge. Team Disinfectant Wipes contains Jing Li, Boya Sun, Jiangfan Jin and Sute Li.

### Goal
Our project aims to quantify the effect of the awareness of wearing a mask in slowing the spread of COVID-19. 

### Data Source
- Google trend data
- Stay-at-home order data
- Medical resources data

### Analysis and Result
Our team combined all the data from different data source and selected the best-performing fixed effect model to identify the effect of the awareness of wearing masks against COVID-19.

We found that the increase in the awareness of wearing masks (quantified by search interest on Google) was most associated with lowering the increase in confirmed cases of COVID-19. That is to say, when people start to search for masks, that' s when they truly became aware of how serious the pandemic situation is, and started to take precautions. Hence, we recommended that state governments should advise (if not require) all citizens to wear masks in public as early as they could.
